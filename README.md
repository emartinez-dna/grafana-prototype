# Getting Started #

To get started, run `start-solution`.  

This will spin up all of the solution's docker containers on your physical machine's docker engine.  Likewise, to stop your solution's containers, run `stop-solution`.

There are various commands in the `auto` folder of this repository.  Please review that folder for more information.

For your convenience, your laptop's `~/.ssh` folder is mounted into this dev container.  This will give you permissions to perform github operations right inside the container.
